  "body": "Olá! I am Mariana and I come from a tiny city in a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic that - more by accident than anything else - happens to belong to Portugal.\r\nI have a diploma that says I am a “Communication Designer”, but no one actually ever explained to me what that really means, so I usually just tell people that I am a graphic designer who also does a bit of photography, illustration, web design, user interface, writing and overall world domination.\r\nEven though my teachers always made sure to emphasize how important learning how to code was, they made sure that the only class available was almost impossible to attend: besides having the most terrible schedule EVER (with people dropping out because it was just not manageable), it also happened to be in the semester when probably 95% of the students take part of the Erasmus+ program. Of course that when I figured this out I was already eating frietjes inside my small kot in Antwerp.\r\nEver since, coding has always been in the back of my head, poking me here and there to remind me that I should actually be learning it instead of playing League of Legends for hours in a row. So I enrolled in Khan Academy and created this soon-to-be-amazing blog/portfolio that I will use to develop my skills and keep a record of my evolution, from basic HTML to, well, world domination!  \r\n",
